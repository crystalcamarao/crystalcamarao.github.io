I have to read the news--or at least the headlines and descriptions--on a regular basis because of one of my part-time jobs. It fascinates me that different news outlets have different ways of portraying the news. This is highly obvious, of course (especially probably for a communications or journalism major), but the news highly depends on who is saying it.
