title: Framing it as Rest

I often wonder where my day went. So I recently started using an activity tracker, and I noticed something: I spend a lot of time resting.

I could easily frame it as doing nothing, but I value rest and instead think that even when I'm doing nothing, it's actually productive because I am resting.

Rest is important. It isn't rocket science. Too much rest is bad, for sure. And I'm lucky enough that my schedule is fairly flexible--I can work whenever I want to, as long as I finish my tasks for the day. There's also stuff like the fact that I don't have to commute (I work from home), I don't have to do household stuff (in the Philippines it's very normal to have a maid), and I don't have anyone to take care of (I have no dependents).

I believe that if I didn't spend this much time resting, I wouldn't be able to get anything done. Especially when you think about how the traditional 8-hour workday [doesn't make much sense](https://youmatter.world/en/schedules-working-days-productivity/) anyway.

That doesn't mean I'm as productive as I want to be. I waste a lot of time surfing the internet, for example. I'm also easily distracted.
