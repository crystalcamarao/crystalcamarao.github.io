I keep thinking about how I built Three Things Daily, or at least the MVP, in a weekend. If I can do it, what's stopping other people? The barrier to entry is low, and I need to up my game if I want it to be successful.

Three Things Daily is very simple. According to the feedback I got from people who are not my family nor friends (so I know they're not just being nice or whatever), it's what they like about it. But I wonder if its simplicity will be its downfall.
