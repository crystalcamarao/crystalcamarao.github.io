I believe in lifelong learning--I'm constantly looking for ways to improve my skills in web design and digital marketing. And when it came to learning providers, [CXL Institute was an obvious choice](https://cxl.com/institute/reviews/#_r_crystal80).

I decided to take their [Digital Psychology and Persuasion Minidegree](https://cxl.com/institute/programs/digital-psychology-persuasion-training/#_r_crystal80) because I want to get better at understanding people and how they think and behave digitally. This will in turn help me get better at making websites and copy and get higher conversion rates.

Psychology is something any marketer or designer would benefit to learn more about. By understanding human behavior--what people want, what people need, etc.--you are able to effectively market to them and thus persuade them. I think this is especially true today in the digital world because of all the noise constantly trying to grab our attention.

Having no psychology background (unless you count the three-unit Psychology 101 course I took back in college), I didn't know much about the psychological principles you can apply to improve websites and optimize for conversions.

I'm currently trying to change that with the help of this Minidegree. I'm really excited to be doing it. And since I was given a scholarship, I will be writing one article per week for the next twelve weeks about it.

Allow me to share my thoughts on it as I go through it.

The first track of this Minidegree is **Psychology Foundations**, where psychological principles that drive human behavior are taught. It attempts to answer the following questions:

* How can we capture and hold attention?

* How capable are we of making truly rational decisions?

* To what extent do first impressions, visuals, and emotions affect our ability to learn information?

This week, I finished 2 courses from this track.

## People & psychology

This course is by Peep Laja, founder of CXL. In 9 lessons, he teaches us how we can understand people so we can convert them.

### Cialdini’s 7 Principles of Persuasion

Robert Cialdini's book *Influence* is a book that most marketers recommend, so I'm not surprised this was taught. Laja explained Cialdini's principles with relevant, actionable examples.

### Fogg Behavior Model

Laja then explained Dr. BJ Fogg's research on credibility and behavioral design. The $300 million dollar button story was particularly interesting for me. Moral of the story: enable guest checkout!

### Lessons from Neuromarketing

This lesson talked about the Old Brain, the ancient and primitive part of our brain, and how it dominates our brain when making decisions. The lesson ended with a TEDx Talk by Patrick Renvoise (I rather enjoyed this).

### A Big List of Persuasion Techniques

Laja went on to explain a lot of persuasion techniques. And by a lot, I mean a lot lot. I counted 40. It was a lot to take in but it was just as interesting as the other lessons.

### Cognitive Biases – We’re All Affected By Them

This lesson taught some of the more common biases faced during CRO work (it required a bit of a background in CRO to understand but I think I got it). It's good to be aware of the biases we have in order to handle them better.

### Emotional and Rational Decision Making

Laja started by stating a fact that was very surprising for me: "well over 90% of our behavior is generated outside of consciousness". Then I learned about how important it is to sell to the old brain but serve both the emotional and rational parts of our brain.

### How People View Websites

Eyetracking and research have shown us how people view websites. The first part of the lesson was not at all new to me, but still very valuable to be reminded of. Knowing things like F-patterns really helps in making websites that are engaging. The latter part of the lesson was new to me and I'm sure it will really help me.
