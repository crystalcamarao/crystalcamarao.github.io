Psychology is something any marketer would benefit to learn more about. By understanding human behavior--what people want, what people need, etc.--you are able to effectively market to them and thus persuade them. And in today's digital world, psychological principles can be applied to improve websites and optimize conversions.

I'm all for improving my skills in web design and digital marketing. CXL Institute came as a natural choice, and I decided to take the Digital Psychology and Persuasion Minidegree in particular for 2 main reasons:

1. I want to get better at understanding people and how they think and behave digitally. This will in turn help me get better at making websites that have high conversion rates.

2. I've always been fascinated with how technology has impacted people and society. I think that digital psychology is super duper fascinating because the world was profoundly changed by the internet and there are a gazillion things we are thankful for it, but also not thankful for it.

I've very excited to do this Minidegree. Allow me to share the lessons I've learned as I go through it.

The first track of this Minidegree is **Psychology Foundations**, where psychological principles that drive human behavior are taught. It attempts to answer the following questions:

* How can we capture and hold attention?

* How capable are we of making truly rational decisions?

* To what extent do first impressions, visuals, and emotions affect our ability to learn information?

This week, I finished 2 courses from this track.

## People & psychology

This course is by Peep Laja, founder of CXL. In 9 lessons, he teaches us how we can understand people so we can convert them.

### Cialdini’s 7 Principles of Persuasion

Robert Cialdini's book *Influence* is a book that most marketers recommend, so I'm not surprised this was taught. The 7 principles are:

1. Reciprocity - we feel obliged to be nice to someone who was also nice to us;

2. Commitment/consistency - we are more likely to deliver on a commitment when we publicly committed to it;

3. Social Proof

4. Authority

5. Liking;

6. Scarcity; and

7. Unity (more on this, apparently, on the second track).
