Psychology is something any marketer would benefit to learn more about. By understanding human behavior--what people want, what people need, etc.--you are able to effectively market to them and thus persuade them. I think this is especially true today in the digital world because of all the noise constantly trying to grab our attention.

Psychological principles can be applied if you want to improve websites and optimize conversions. Obviously, this is something I want to do. But having no psychology background (unless you count the 3-unit Psychology 101 course I took back in college), I didn't know any of these principles.

Now, I'm the kind of person who believes in lifelong learning. I'm all for improving my skills in web design and digital marketing. And when it came to learning providers, [CXL Institute was an obvious choice](https://cxl.com/institute/reviews/#_r_crystal80).

I decided to take their [Digital Psychology and Persuasion Minidegree](https://cxl.com/institute/programs/digital-psychology-persuasion-training/#_r_crystal80) for 2 main reasons:

1. I want to get better at understanding people and how they think and behave digitally. This will in turn help me get better at making websites and copy that have high conversion rates.

2. I've always been fascinated with how technology has impacted people and society. I think that digital psychology is super duper fascinating because the world was profoundly changed by the internet and there are a gazillion things we are thankful for it, but also not thankful for it.

I've excited to do this Minidegree. Allow me to share my thoughts on it as I go through it.

The first track of this Minidegree is **Psychology Foundations**, where psychological principles that drive human behavior are taught. It attempts to answer the following questions:

* How can we capture and hold attention?

* How capable are we of making truly rational decisions?

* To what extent do first impressions, visuals, and emotions affect our ability to learn information?

This week, I finished 2 courses from this track.

## People & psychology

This course is by Peep Laja, founder of CXL. In 9 lessons, he teaches us how we can understand people so we can convert them.

### Cialdini’s 7 Principles of Persuasion

Robert Cialdini's book *Influence* is a book that most marketers recommend, so I'm not surprised this was taught. Laja explained Cialdini's principles with relevant, actionable examples.
