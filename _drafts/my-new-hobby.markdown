A couple of days ago the Google Play Store approved my first-ever mobile app, [My Prayer Requests](https://myprayerrequests.app). I made it for my mom and it was inspired by my Bible counselor. Basically, it's a prayer journal and community app.

I made My Prayer Requests using Adalo, a no-code tool for building apps. It wasn't that difficult. It was fun! Addicting, even. Now, making apps is officially my new hobby. I'm about to make a new one, this time for Aunt, for her Bible study group. I can't wait to get even more app ideas.
