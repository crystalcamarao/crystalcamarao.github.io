For days now I've been contemplating whether I should turn Three Things Daily into a mobile app or not. Until now I haven't decided yet, so let me write down my thoughts about it.

The most important feature it would have is a daily reminder notification where a user can set to what time a reminder for them to post will be sent out every day. Besides that, it's just going to be a native app version of the current website.

This daily reminder feature is requested by a few users so I know it would help them. It would help me too because of higher user retention rates.

The problem is I have no idea when it comes to making mobile apps. I have never coded my own mobile app before. And when I tried searching for no-code tools, I couldn't find any that could integrate very well with the Wordpress API.

So I'm stuck: should I learn to code on my own, or should I leave it to someone else by either hiring someone or looking for a CTO co-founder?

I have yet to find out. The second and third options don't sound good since I don't really expect to make money from it. And first option is probably the worst idea since I have a lot on my plate, especially right now.
