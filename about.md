I love [making websites](https://estel.design), but there's more to me than that. I go to spinning class regularly, [travel](https://instagram.com/ohtheplacescrystalwillgo) as much as possible, and try to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/crystalcamarao) and learn new things daily. I’m not one to turn down discussing tech, watching sci-fi/fantasy, and most especially, [drinking a pint of IPA](https://untappd.com/user/crystalbeatrice). I'm an aspiring dog mom, and will adopt a dog someday when the time is right.

Random facts about me:

* I lived in Japan for a couple of years, something that I still look back on as some of the coolest, most interesting years of my life--but I believe the best is yet to come.

* I'm a big fan of *The Lord of the Rings*, to the point that I once tried to learn Elvish (yes, both Quenya and Sindarin).

* More coming soon when I think of them!
