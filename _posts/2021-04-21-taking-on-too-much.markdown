I hit a milestone in my freelancing career this month. But at what cost? I took on too much work, and now I'm paying for it.

I have 2 part-time jobs, a couple of ongoing freelance projects, and [3 side projects](/projects). Plus I'm studying for a CXL Institute Minidegree. It's kinda crazy, right? I know I have to let go of some of my commitments.

The first that had to go was my CXL Institute Minidegree. It pains me because it's kinda well-known that a CXL certificate will cause your inbox to be full of recruiters looking to hire you. But it's just not the right time. Hopefully, in the future, I will finish it. Thankfully, I was allowed to pause my scholarship for now.

The next that will have to go is one part-time job. I'm torn especially because I don't like ending things and also because it will be less income for me. But I just can't sustain it any longer, so I know it would be the right decision for me. I don't know which one yet to part with, but hopefully, it will turn out well.

I believe that with these steps, I will be able to lessen my stress by a lot and really give my best to all my commitments. It goes without saying that taking on too much will not help you. I guess I had to learn that lesson the hard way.
