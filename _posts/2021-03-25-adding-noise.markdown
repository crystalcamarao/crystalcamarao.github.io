I committed to writing a blog post every other day because I want to practice writing. One thing I constantly try to ask is whether I'm adding noise or not. As in, am I actually producing content that provides value to anyone? Or is it just noise?

Today, we are all bombarded with a ton of content. So many things are trying to grab our attention. And sometimes, as I wrote before, [we could be wasting our time, etc. on content that's just not worth it](https://medium.com/writers-guild/everything-on-the-internet-is-an-exchange-959c89f2390b).

My hope is that I'm NOT adding noise. I don't want to churn out a ton of content that's not useful to anyone.
