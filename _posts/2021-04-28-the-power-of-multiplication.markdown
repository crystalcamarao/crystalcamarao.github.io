In no way am I a finance expert (I AM THE EXACT OPPOSITE), but I realized something recently when it comes to saving money: for subscriptions, you save a ton of money just by choosing a cheaper option.

Namecheap has been my domain registrar of choice for years, and I absolutely love them (their support is awesome), but now I'm slowly in the process of moving all my domains to Porkbun just because it's more cost-effective. 

If you don't know, domain registration is a yearly thing. Assuming I live until 60, I'll save a ton of money by using Porkbun even if it's just a difference of $5 a year (more or less).

This is especially true since I own about 8 domains plus 3 that I co-own plus a few more that I handle for our family.

That's the power of multiplication for you. When you pay it on a yearly basis and on an individual basis, $5 may not be much. But if you think long-term and think about the sum of parts, it's actually a lot.

Now if only there are cheaper options for my other subscriptions, like Elementor Pro ($199/year). Alas, there aren't any.
