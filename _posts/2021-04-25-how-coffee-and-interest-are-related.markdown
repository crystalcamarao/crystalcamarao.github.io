I realized something recently: the less interested I am in the task at hand, the more coffee I need, and the more interested I am in the task at hand, the less coffee I need. In other words, they're inversely related, at least for me.

Coffee is good for you, studies show. But it is also widely known that consumption of too much coffee isn't and that it should be consumed on a moderate basis. In the past weeks, there have been days where I had 3 or even 4 cups. That's a lot for me.

So I need to work on either increasing my interest in the tasks at hand or changing the tasks themselves. The second isn't really an option for me right now, while the first feels too hard. Foregoing coffee altogether doesn't work either because I can't work without caffeine.

Viktor Frankl said that "When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves." Everyone has had situations where they could not change anything, so I feel this is something we can relate to. I guess that means I will have to increase my interest in the tasks at hand.
